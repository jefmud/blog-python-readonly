# blog-python-readonly
This project is a simple blog that is a remote endpoint for an API.  It purposely does not contain write capability.  I am intending it for article "syndication" purposes on a host with limited resources (e.g. CGI python 2.7.x)

The code will works with Flask < 2.0 on Python 2.7.x and Flask 2.x for Python 3.6.x and greater.

It could easily be ported to Django, Bottle, or Minimus (my personal framework). Of course, it can be easily ported to PHP or Node.js too (depending on your host).

Comments are welcome, though, be kind.
